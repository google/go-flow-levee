# Developing Go Flow Levee

## Debugging

The main analyzer depends heavily on the [golang.org/x/tools/ssa](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/ssa) package. Being able to read the SSA code and visualize its graph can be very useful for debugging. In order to generate the SSA code and DOT ([graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)) source for every function in a test, run `go test <package> -debug`. Results are written to the `output` directory. You can generate a PDF from the DOT source using `dot -Tpdf <file> -o "$(basename <file> .dot).pdf"`.

Currently, debugging is only supported for the `levee` analyzer. In order to add support for debugging in a new test, first add a debugging flag:
```go
var debugging bool = flag.Bool("debug", false, "run the debug analyzer")
```
Then add `debug.Analyzer` as a dependency of the analyzer being tested:
```go
if *debugging {
	Analyzer.Requires = append(Analyzer.Requires, debug.Analyzer)
}
```

In the `dot` output:
* A **red** edge points to a **Referrer** of an `ssa.Node`
* An **orange** edge points to an **Operand** of an `ssa.Node`
* **Rectangle**-shaped nodes represent `ssa.Node`s that are both `ssa.Instruction`s and `ssa.Value`s
* **Diamond**-shaped nodes represent `ssa.Node`s that are only `ssa.Instruction`s
* **Ellipse**-shaped nodes represent `ssa.Node`s that are either only `ssa.Value`s, or are `ssa.Member`s.

The function's control-flow graph (CFG) is also produced and written in a file named `<function-name>-cfg.dot`.
