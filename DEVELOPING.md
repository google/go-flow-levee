# Developing Go Flow Levee

## Testing Your Changes Against a Large Codebase

When creating a pull request, you must verify that your changes are safe by running them on a large codebase such as [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). This is not intended as a replacement for proper automated testing. Running without error on a large codebase provides an additional level of confidence, since a large codebase is likely to contain edge cases that you may not have considered. Indeed, such edge cases have caused failures in the past ([#74](https://github.com/google/go-flow-levee/pull/74), [#143](https://github.com/google/go-flow-levee/pull/143)).

Here's an example script showing how you can test your changes against [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -eux

# set these to appropriate values for your setup
# GO_FLOW_LEVEE_PATH=path to the root of the go-flow-levee repository on your machine
# K8S_PATH="$GOPATH"/src/k8s.io/kubernetes

cd "$GO_FLOW_LEVEE_PATH"/cmd/levee
go install

cd "$K8S_PATH"
git checkout master
git pull
CFG_PATH="$(realpath ./hack/testdata/levee/levee-config.yaml)"
make vet WHAT="-vettool=$(which levee) -config=$CFG_PATH"
```

## Recommended Reading

Having some knowledge of the following packages is helpful when developing Go Flow Levee:

* [golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis](https://golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis)

The `analysis` package provides a framework for developing Go static analyzers. A good overview of the framework is provided in the `doc.go` file. For concrete examples, the `passes` directory contains many analyzers. In that directory, the `findcall` analyzer is intended as a simple example. The `nilness` analyzer is particularly interesting for our purposes, since it uses the `ssa` package.

* [golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa](https://golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa)

The `ssa` package provides a [Static Single Assignment (SSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form) form for Go code. This is the main code representation used by Go Flow Levee, as it provides a way to track the flow of data in a program. The `doc.go` file provides a good overview of the main concepts. The main types (e.g., instructions, values) are defined in `ssa.go`.

* [golang.org/go/types](https://golang.org/pkg/go/types)

The `types` package provides information about types in a Go program. The most relevant files for our uses are `api.go` and `object.go`. For a deeper understanding, there is a nice tutorial about using the `types` package [here](https://github.com/golang/example/tree/master/gotypes).

* [golang.org/go/ast](https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast)

The `ast` package provides the [Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) of Go code. We use this package to answer questions about the structure of the code, e.g. "does this struct definition have tagged fields" (in the `fieldtags` analyzer). You can view a Go program's AST with `gotype -ast <file>`.

Outside of those packages, we often refer to the [Go Spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec) to determine the proper way to handle various Go constructs.

## TODOs

If you introduce a new TODO, please use `TODO(#issue number)` instead of a plain `TODO` or even `TODO(username)`. Having an issue number gives visibility to the TODO and makes it less likely that it will be forgotten.

## Debugging

The main analyzer depends heavily on the [golang.org/x/tools/ssa](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/ssa) package. Being able to read the SSA code and visualize its graph can be very useful for debugging.

Currently, debugging is only available in the tests for the `levee` package. To obtain the debugging output, run this command: `go test ./... -debug` from the `internal/pkg/levee` directory. The output files are written to a directory named `output` in the root of the repository.

Given a function named `MyFunc` in a package named `mypack`, running `levee`'s tests with `-debug` produces the following files:
* `mypack_MyFunc.ssa`: the SSA code, in a similar fashion to `golang.org/x/tools/cmd/ssadump`
* `mypack_MyFunc.dot`: the DOT ([graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)) code for the function's SSA Operands and Referrers graph
* `mypack_MyFunc-cfg.dot`: the DOT code for the function's [control-flow graph (CFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph)

You can generate a PDF from the DOT source using `dot -Tpdf <file> -o "$(basename <file> .dot).pdf"`.

In the graph:
* An **orange** edge points to an **Operand** of an `ssa.Node`
* A **red** edge points to a **Referrer** of an `ssa.Node`
* **Rectangle**-shaped nodes represent `ssa.Node`s that are both `ssa.Instruction`s and `ssa.Value`s
* **Diamond**-shaped nodes represent `ssa.Node`s that are only `ssa.Instruction`s
* **Ellipse**-shaped nodes represent `ssa.Node`s that are either only `ssa.Value`s, or are `ssa.Member`s.

In order to add support for debugging in a new package, first add a debugging flag:
```go
var debugging bool = flag.Bool("debug", false, "run the debug analyzer")
```

Then add `debug.Analyzer` as a dependency of the analyzer being tested:
```go
if *debugging {
	Analyzer.Requires = append(Analyzer.Requires, debug.Analyzer)
}
```
